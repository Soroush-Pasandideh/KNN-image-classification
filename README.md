In this phase, we were asked to use the features prepared from the images of the flower102 dataset to first categorize the data without supervision (unsupervised) using the k-means algorithm, 
and then in the next section, by dividing the data into smaller groups and using the k-Nearest neighbors algorithm, we find the best score.
